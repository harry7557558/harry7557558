# About Me

## My Position and Bias
 - Highly individualized, "cursed" communication, feel isolated from society
 - Passionate about specific areas of STEM, sometimes too passinate
 - Reflective
 - View engineering design as a fun activity, not necessary practical or beneficial

## Understanding of Engineering Design
 - Mathematical optimization: find a global minimum
 - Can be quantized through framing, but not required
 - Go fast -> not optimal
 - FDCR: genetic algorithm
 - Iterative design: gradient descent
 - Judgement before testing to save effort

## Values and Skills
 - Strong intuition: understanding, learning, analyzing, using things
 - Reflective: identify the causes of failure and success
 - Concentration without distraction

## Weaknesses
 - Values and skills can correspond to weakness
 - Enthuasiasm -> overlook important things, hand on without through research
 - Strong intuition -> not rigorously and systematically
 - Reflective -> excessive pride and inferiority
 - Difficult to let go
 - Communication: just cursed, isolation is a solution?
