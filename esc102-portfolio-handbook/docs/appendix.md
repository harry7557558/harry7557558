ITP


# Individual Assessment Results

 - All in the past week, intended to be curious about what test problems are like so answered all to my best based on evidence without much bias on alternating results (like some did previously)

 - Surprised and bothered me because results are in the extremes (unexpected)

 - Reason to include this: making people understand myself more is one of my top objectives but doesn't always fit the assignment requirements

## Empathy Index (EQ)
 - Include this because it's often used as a metric for communication and teamwork, I want to check considering my personality
 - 14/80
 - (Expected to be 30-40 based on what other people got)
 - Avoidance doesn't sound like a virtue word but it's what has been proven to work out the best

## ITP Personality
 - Extraversion: moderate activity level and excitement seeking, low friendliness and assertiveness
 - Emotionality: high vulnerability, melancholic, and immoderation
 - Conscientious: moderate achievement-striving, low self-efficacy, very low dependability
 - Agreeableness: all low, altruism is the lowest
 - Openness: near high liberalism and imagination, low sentimentality
 - Reflection: report accurately match my previous reflection of myself, almost all negatively affect teamwork in some way based on previous experience, activity level and excitement seeking helps both team and individual, liberalism hinders teamwork but logically might promote individual although not proven by evidence

## ITP Risk Management
 - (state, don't comment)
 - High dominating (77), moderate avoiding (60) and accommodating (54), low compromising (21), extremely low integrating (6)
