<h1>Tools, Models, and Frameworks</h1>

This page lists the models and tools that I have used before and would like to consider for future use. Based on my understanding of engineering design process as an optimization problem, I order them by the steps of engineering design: framing, diverging and converging, iterative design, and communication. I chose to put communication in a separate section considering I'm an individualized person whose previous engineering design expereinces are done on my own. Reflecting on my past success and failure experiences, I found many of these TMFs controversial, and I evaluate them and argue their effectiveness with logic and evidence.

# Personal Engineering Design Models

## Hoover Dam
 - Transform real world -> models, models are easier to solve and analyze
 - Evidence: UTAT, personal projects
 - Useful when the problem can be easily math'd; (robotics, scientific computing, CG)
 - Not good for lots of human factors
 - Issues: framing can be inaccurate, unexpected issues; Need to leave something to validation

## Framing, Diverging, Converging, Represent
 - Global optimization done by humans
 - Divergence: avoid bias and blind spots, usually done in teams; Individual: research reference designs
 - Convergence: eliminate through research/analysis, analogous to shortcuts/interpolation for numerical optimization
 - Negotiate objectives during diverging and testing
 - Make more detailed/specific through iterations (refinement in optimization)
 - Be patient, too fast -> bad results

## Requirements Model
 - Give a direction; what the design wants
 - Encourages better understanding of stakeholders
 - Personal projects: less tweaking back and forth
 - Evidence: nurdle, robotics
 - Drawback: metrics can be not representative
 - Requires both intuition and primary/secondary research for good framing, negotiate objectives; judgement

Follow an order of design process (after understanding the problem)
 - Do some individual brainstorming (biomimicry, attribute listing, lotus bloosom, etc.) before secondary research to avoid anchoring
 - Generate a variety of ideas through brainwriting

## Biomimicry
 - Inspired by nature; Nature is good at optimization;
 - Suitable for me, it's an individual acticity itself, and I'm a fan of nature
 - Advantages: take a mental break
 - Think similar problems in nature itself is a diverging activity?
 - Examples: simulated annealing for CIV; valve mask;


## Secondary Research for Reference Designs
 - Different start points, especially useful when I'm working on my own
 - Google search is good for most software related stuff (most personal projects)
 - Research databases for standards; (example: 3D model representation)
 - ChatGPT: find search terms, list existing solutions to a problem; (example: nonlinear FEM solvers, hand shovel)

## Brainwriting
 - description
 - Use: praxis I, early praxis II
 - Advantages: a variety of inputs, reduce fixedness; timed manner, stimulate ideas
 - Disadvantages: done in teams, can be tiring and therefore do whatever looks "good"


## Functional Decomposition


## Pairwise Comparison & Pugh Chart
 - Used for decision making


## SCAMPER


## Waterfall Methodology

# Communication: Toulmin's Model of Argument

Like taught earlier in Praxis I, the model of arguments consists of ground, different types of claims, evidence, qualifiers, counterclaims, etc. When use in practice, like presenting my idea or suggestion to my teammates, I mostly understand it as when I give an argument, I need to give clear claims, argue it based on the ground with logic and evidence, and sometimes point out where the idea and suggestion is applicable and where it isn't.

I found the practical effect of the model of arguments to be controversial. I feel in a team without much discrepancy in knowledge (like my design team in UTAT), using such a model is unnecessary, because all members can immediately get the idea without much misunderstanding when an suggestion is pointed out, and following a standard way can instead make communication lengthy and therefore unclear and make the situation awkward. However, considering my weakness in communication throughout my course project teams, I feel it's worthy to keep such a model in my handbook.

Honestly, I feel the model of arguments has helped me a lot throughout praxis courses. Earlier in praxis I, I tried to give feedback to my teammates by stating the problem I notice and potential fixes, but little of them were understood and considered. Team members would just say it's not a good idea for whatever reason and continue their discussion, or even without such an explaination. The setbacks made me learn not to give feedback and keep ideas to myself, which was the case for a large part of praxis I and earlier praxis II. I honestly thought my ideas aren't pointless and can sometimes even save a day, but I was just afraid to communicate them, only because I tagged myself to be poor at communication.

I started using the model of arguments after a "revealation" experience (or psychosis if you prefer this term). I rememeber the time I used it was in praxis II when we were discussing about scoping the design space, where other teammates were anchored to scoping to nurdle collection, and I can't remember much details about their reason. I gave the claim that we should focus on separation instead. I told them based on our diverging activity done in the previous day, separation has a much larger solution space than collection, and there are a variety of reference designs available that covers different technical area, and every team member should be able to find the part they are enthuasiastic about. In contrast, many reference and diverged solutions for collection don't meet the objectives, and there isn't much room to do better than the existing solution. And while one member tried to argue, everyone soon saw the potential of separation, and we agreed we'll focus on separation while not completely abandon collection.

I continued to intentionally provide feedback with logic and evidence in later team activities. However, I soon noticed the issue: my team members prefer just give the main point to keep it concise, while I sent long messages, and they were often just passively follow me, and I seem have become the dominatig member in the team. While I tried to ask them for feedback with questions like "what do you think?", they often just answered "good", and sometimes ask questions about details of the plan that are trivial to answer. Two teammates were responsible for making the poster and constantly asked for feedback. While I continued presenting my long messages with model of arguments, they tend to give a thumbs up reaction without commenting on them or taking them into practice. While they also asked teaching assistants for feedback, many of the TA's feedback overlap with my earlier feedback, and I doubt whether I communicated clearly enough, or if they just ignored my long "essays."

The conflict occurred during the weekend before the showcase on Monday. I know the objective of the handbook is not telling a long story, but I feel there's a need to clarify this. On Friday night, my teammates were working on the poster, and I had an assignment for another course due midnight, and I promised them I'll look at the poster and try to improve it after I finish the assignment, and they gave a thumbs up reaction like they always did. However, at midnight, I looked at the poster and tried to give feedback, I found other teammates working "intensely" on the poster and I couldn't find a way to interrupt, and I waited for them to sleep and started working on it at about 4am.

Based on my past experiences with the model of arguments, I concluded the circumstances when it is feasible, as well as attentions required for delivery. Here I list them below.

<u>Arguing with logic and evidence can be helpful when (and in the opposite case the argument should be kept straightforward):</u>

 - **The team is short-term with unfamiliar members.** I observed that highly effective arguing can result in domination and make the team less psychologically safe, which is necessary for a long-term team where mutual trust is important. The negative impact on psychologically safety is less critical for a temporary team.

 - **All team members are willing to argue and give feedback.** When everyone is willing to argue due to a small discrepancy in required knowledge/skills and high confidence, the imbalance between domination and accommodation will be less a problem.

 - **A domination would be beneficial based on consideration.** In case a team has members specialized in specific areas, a domination with effective arguing can enable the member to show his/her strength and benefit the team. However, this needs to be done after subjective consideration of other member's opinions and delivered carefully to minimize conflicts.

 - **The communication is done through text.** I feel humans tend to have short memory in oral communication, and many points can be missed in an oral speech. In a text communication tool like online chats and email, people can read back to understand the components of an argument and take time to consider. For an oral meeting, presenting the ideas in text beforehand can potentially benefit.

<u>Some attentions need to be paid to during and after arguing:</u>

 - **Keep the message concise.** If the message is too long or has too much information, audiences can become tired and sometime don't even read the message. It can be helpful to point out the claim first because I feel audiences have more impression on the first point.

 - **Encourage open-ended feedback.** Encouraging open-ended feedback can motivate audiences to think about the problem, and specific questions about part of the argument can help understanding. While I haven't tried it yet, I learned from a teamwork strategist that asking for feedback in a timed manner (ex. "You have one minute to let me know what you think of this idea") can have stimulating effects.

Considering these tips are largely concluded from my failure experiences and have not been validated in practice, as well as my born weakness in communication, these tips likely need to be adjusted and/or replaced based on their practical issues, which can be tested during future teamwork activities. Communication and teamwork with continue to be something that I need to experiment with and improve on during their use in practice.
