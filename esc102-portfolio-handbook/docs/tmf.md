# Tools, Models, and Frameworks

This page lists the models and tools that I have used before and would like to consider for future use. Based on my understanding of engineering design process as an optimization problem, I order them by the steps of engineering design: framing, diverging and converging, iterative design, and finally communication. I chose to put communication in a separate section considering I'm an individualized person whose previous engineering design expereinces are done on my own. Reflecting on my past success and failure experiences, I found many of these TMFs controversial, and I evaluate them and argue their effectiveness with logic and evidence.


## Personal Engineering Design Models

#### Hoover Dam
 - Transform real world -> models, models are easier to solve and analyze
 - Evidence: UTAT, personal projects
 - Useful when the problem can be easily math'd; (robotics, scientific computing, CG)
 - Not good for lots of human factors
 - Issues: framing can be inaccurate, unexpected issues; Need to leave something to validation

#### Framing, Diverging, Converging, Represent
 - Global optimization done by humans
 - Divergence: avoid bias and blind spots, usually done in teams; Individual: research reference designs
 - Convergence: eliminate through research/analysis, analogous to shortcuts/interpolation for numerical optimization
 - Negotiate objectives during diverging and testing
 - Make more detailed/specific through iterations (refinement in optimization)
 - Be patient, too fast -> bad results

#### Requirements Model
 - Give a direction; what the design wants
 - Encourages better understanding of stakeholders
 - Evidence: nurdle, robotics
 - Drawback: metrics can be not representative
 - Requires both intuition and primary/secondary research for good framing, negotiate objectives; judgement

Follow an order of design process (after understanding the problem)
 - Do some individual brainstorming (biomimicry, attribute listing, lotus bloosom, etc.) before secondary research to avoid anchoring
 - Generate a variety of ideas through brainwriting

#### Biomimicry
 - Inspired by nature; Nature is good at optimization;
 - Suitable for me, it's an individual acticity itself, and I'm a fan of nature
 - Advantages: take a mental break
 - Think similar problems in nature itself is a diverging activity?
 - Examples: simulated annealing for CIV; valve mask;


#### Secondary Research for Reference Designs
 - Different start points, especially useful when I'm working on my own
 - Google search is good for most software related stuff (most personal projects)
 - Research databases for standards; (example: 3D model representation)
 - ChatGPT: find search terms, list existing solutions to a problem; (example: nonlinear FEM solvers, hand shovel)

#### Brainwriting


#### Functional Decomposition


#### SCAMPER


#### Pairwise Comparison & Pugh Chart


#### Waterfall Methodology



## Communication: Toulmin's Model of Arguments

Like taught earlier in Praxis I, the model of arguments consists of ground, different types of claims, evidence, qualifiers, counterclaims, etc. When use in practice, like presenting my idea or suggestion to my teammates, I mostly understand it as when I give an argument, I need to give clear claims, argue it based on the ground with logic and evidence, and sometimes point out where the idea and suggestion is applicable and where it isn't.

I found the practical effect of the model of arguments to be controversial. I feel in a team without much discrepancy in knowledge (like my design team in UTAT), using such a model is unnecessary, because all members can immediately get the idea without much misunderstanding when an suggestion is pointed out, and following a standard way can instead make communication lengthy and therefore unclear and make the situation awkward. However, considering my weakness in communication throughout my course project teams, I feel it's worthy to keep such a model in my handbook.

Honestly, I feel the model of arguments has helped me a lot throughout praxis courses. Earlier in praxis I, I tried to give feedback to my teammates by stating the problem I notice and potential fixes, but little of them were understood and considered. Team members would just say it's not a good idea for whatever reason and continue their discussion, or even without such an explaination. The setbacks made me learn not to give feedback and keep ideas to myself, which was the case for a large part of praxis I and earlier praxis II. I honestly thought my ideas aren't pointless and can sometimes even save a day, but I was just afraid to communicate them, only because I tagged myself to be poor at communication.

I started using the model of arguments after a "revealation" experience (or psychosis if you prefer this term). I rememeber the time I used it was in praxis II when we were discussing about scoping the design space, where other teammates were anchored to scoping to nurdle collection, and I can't remember much details about their reason. I gave the claim that we should focus on separation instead. I told them based on our diverging activity done in the previous day, separation has a much larger solution space than collection, and there are a variety of reference designs available that covers different technical area, and every team member should be able to find the part they are enthuasiastic about. In contrast, many reference and diverged solutions for collection don't meet the objectives, and there isn't much room to do better than the existing solution. And while one member tried to argue, everyone soon saw the potential of separation, and we agreed we'll focus on separation while not completely abandon collection.

I continued to intentionally provide feedback with logic and evidence in later team activities. However, I soon noticed the issue: my team members prefer just give the main point to keep it concise, while I sent long messages, and they were often just passively follow me, and I seem have become the dominatig member in the team. While I tried to ask them for feedback with questions like "what do you think?", they often just answered "good", and sometimes ask questions about details of the plan that are trivial to answer. Two teammates were responsible for making the poster and constantly asked for feedback. While I continued presenting my long messages with model of arguments, they tend to give a thumbs up reaction without commenting on them or taking them into practice. While they also asked teaching assistants for feedback, many of the TA's feedback overlap with my earlier feedback, and I doubt whether I communicated clearly enough, or if they just ignored my long "essays."

The conflict occurred during the weekend before the showcase on Monday. I know the objective of the handbook is not telling a long story, but I feel there's a need to clarify this. On Friday night, my teammates were working on the poster, and I had an assignment for another course due midnight, and I promised them I'll look at the poster and try to improve it after I finish the assignment, and they gave a thumbs up reaction like they always did. 

 - Practically controversial based on my experience
 - Make people understand, convince people; Have ideas that I think are good, previously no one listened when I just spoke
    - Often online through text chat before meetings so people have time to consider
 - Evidence
    - Praxis I: no one listened, became afraid to argue
    - Early Praxis II: no motivation based on praxis I
    - Start using model of arguments, people become convinced
    - People think I'm rude, stopped listening to me and ignore me, still give their ideas without model of arguments
 - Drawback
    - Awkward, less psychologically safe
    - Makes messages much longer, people have short memories and don't get it; Or just don't read a long essay at all
    - Makes people accept passively, even if I intentionally encourage feedback
 - Useful when:
    - New/unfamiliar people
    - Everyone is equally like to argue and give feedback
    - When domination makes it better (fter judgement)
