# Tools, Models, and Frameworks

 - Models for individual design, based on my understanding
 - Divergence and Convergence tools
 - Communication: separate section


## Personal Engineering Design Models

#### Hoover Dam
 - Transform real world -> models, models are easier to solve and analyze
 - Evidence: UTAT, personal projects
 - Useful when the problem can be easily math'd; (robotics, scientific computing, CG)
 - Not good for lots of human factors
 - Issues: framing can be inaccurate, unexpected issues; Need to leave something to validation

#### Framing, Diverging, Converging, Represent
 - Global optimization done by humans
 - Divergence: avoid bias and blind spots, usually done in teams; Individual: research reference designs
 - Convergence: eliminate through research/analysis, analogous to shortcuts/interpolation for numerical optimization
 - Negotiate objectives during diverging and testing
 - Make more detailed/specific through iterations (refinement in optimization)
 - Be patient, too fast -> bad results

#### Requirements Model
 - Give a direction; what the design wants
 - Encourages better understanding of stakeholders
 - Evidence: nurdle, robotics
 - Drawback: metrics can be not representative
 - Requires both intuition and primary/secondary research for good framing, negotiate objectives; judgement


## Personal Engineering Design Tools

      - Purpose, how, example, advantage/disadvantage (list)

Follow an order of design process (after understanding the problem)
 - Do some individual brainstorming (biomimicry, attribute listing, lotus bloosom, etc.) before secondary research to avoid anchoring
 - Generate a variety of ideas through brainwriting

#### Biomimicry
 - Inspired by nature; Nature is good at optimization;
 - Suitable for me, it's an individual acticity itself, and I'm a fan of nature
 - Advantages: take a mental break
 - Think similar problems in nature itself is a diverging activity?
 - Examples: simulated annealing for CIV; valve mask;


#### Secondary Research for Reference Designs
 - Different start points, especially useful when I'm working on my own
 - Google search is good for most software related stuff (most personal projects)
 - Research databases for standards; (example: 3D model representation)
 - ChatGPT: find search terms, list existing solutions to a problem; (example: nonlinear FEM solvers, hand shovel)

#### Brainwriting


#### Functional Decomposition


#### SCAMPER


#### Pairwise Comparison & Pugh Chart


#### Waterfall Methodology



## Communication

 - Separate section because I'm individualized, and my personal projects and course/career projects are almost completely separate

#### Toulmin's Model of Arguments
 - Practically controversial based on my experience
 - Make people understand, convince people; Have ideas that I think are good, previously no one listened when I just spoke
    - Often online through text chat before meetings so people have time to consider
 - Evidence
    - Praxis I: no one listened, became afraid to argue
    - Early Praxis II: no motivation based on praxis I
    - Start using model of arguments, people become convinced
    - People think I'm rude, stopped listening to me and ignore me, still give their ideas without model of arguments
 - Drawback
    - Awkward, less psychologically safe
    - Makes messages much longer, people have short memories and don't get it; Or just don't read a long essay at all
    - Makes people accept passively, even if I intentionally encourage feedback
 - Useful when:
    - New/unfamiliar people
    - Everyone is equally like to argue and give feedback
    - When domination makes it better (fter judgement)
