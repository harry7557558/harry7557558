# Personal Engineering Design Processes

Focus on examples, not reflection.

## Framing
 - Understanding what is a good design
 - Want to make web app
    - Mesh: low ratio (research why it's good; log det as metric, better than strain), speed
    - Spirula: rendering speed and accuracy; fps & visual judgement
 - Working with stakeholders
    - Understand what features people (I) need for a matrix visualizer
 - Some numerical metrics are simple; Bridge project: FoS, overall is min of all; Detailed objectives
 - "Good" metric to help converging and for presentation: glass fogginess
 - Some not too simple, holistically/pairwise comparison (ex. volunteer experience)

## Diverging and Converging
 - Global optimization, need diverse feedback
 - Done in teams: two praxis ones, brainwriting
 - Individual: much easier to fall into dead spots; research reference designs for diverse startpoints; Sometimes need force doing research to fight temptation to try own (optimizing marching cubes & edge splitting didn't work); Add novelity based on secondary research (trust region for mesh optimization)
 - Attribute listing: nurdle/wood
 - Biomimicry: glasses
 - Previously (glasses, camera) unbelievable ideas with little secondary research didn't work well, might eliminate if no much secondary research if there's no effort to prototype/test
 - Pairwise comparison mostly match intuition (nurdle), but logically it has potential to reduce bias
 - Pugh chart: worked for praxis I final, not suitable for lots of objectives
 - Manage lots of objectives: 
 - Make sure other objectives are met in not too detailed design; Test and compare specific objectives in detailed design (nurdle)

## Iterative Design
 - Cycles of prototyping/testing/refinement, after converging to a more detailed design
 - Worked well for nurdle separator (SCAMPER + testing), more feedback to reveal unexpected issues
 - Lots of cases in personal projects; sometimes (mesh) research to judge if a design will work before spend time prototyping

## Verification and Validation
 - Framing can be inaccurate (ML camera), direct validation if not too difficult (ex. algorithm like mesh, nurdle)
 - No metric: validate by interviewing AGF
 - Verification: measure glass fogginess and airflow to get metrics for converging
