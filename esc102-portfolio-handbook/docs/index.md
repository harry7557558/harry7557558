# <h1 style="font-size:3.5em;">Engineering Design <br/>Portfolio and Handbook</h1>

<h2>Harry Chen</h2>

--------

This is my engineering portfolio and handbook created for the [Praxis II](https://orientation.engsci.utoronto.ca/esc102-praxis-ii/) course, a first-year undergraduate course about engineering design. While I need to meet certain requirements because this is a marked assignment, I take this as an opportunity to showcase my unique personality, my projects and understanding of engineering design, as well as the struggles I went through trying to figure out how to manage teamwork and my motivation. Despite this page being publicly on the internet, I intentionally made it hidden from search engines. If you are a member of the praxis teaching team or someone who's already familiar with me, I hope I can give you insight into my understanding of myself and engineering design. If you are someone on the internet who somehow found this page, I wish I can show you that I'm someone not "normal" and you'll enjoy reading my story.

This page (as well as every other page under this directory) does not contain any tracker or analytic tool, so your visit is completely invisible to me. While I believe I already have understanding of both myself and the engineering design tools, I hope I can create a comfortable zone for readers interested in me, no matter I'm aware of or not.

## Scoping

Since I take this assignment as an opportinity to present myself, I include whatever I want to say: things I'm proud of, my understanding of engineering design, as well as things stuck in my chest that I want to clarify. In the portfolio, consisting of <u>About Me</u> and <u>Personal Engineering Design Products</u>, I present both my positive and negative aspects to give people an comprehensive view of myself and my activities. In the handbook, consisting of <u>Personal Engineering Design Processes</u> and the <u>TMFs</u>, I try to justify my position and activities, and I take the writing process for a chance to reflect on my past success and failure experiences, so I can figure out what I should keep, avoid, and experiment with.

In the document, I try to discuss the individual parts and the team parts separately, since I consider myself a highly individualized person and I can't find a presentable intermediate between the two. As a thoughtful person who sometimes "gets out of hand", I find the need to scope out some parts and not include them in my portfolio and handbook: medical diagosis regarding my mental condition, difficulties I faced not directly related to engineering design, excessive technical details, etc. As per assignment requirement, I consider projects done before September 2022 to be out of scope. However, I still include some images I created before then that I think can help delivering what I mean.
