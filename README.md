Hello 👋 this is my GitHub profile.
I'm a bit enslaved ⛓️ by **numerical techniques** including but not limited to **computer graphics**,
and you can find a lot of works about these topics ~~written from scratch~~ on my GitHub.
This README is intended to be a guide for you to browse [my stuff 🧐](./list-of-projects.md).

My **cool** 😎 stuffs include the
[3D implicit surface grapher 🐙](https://harry7557558.github.io/spirulae/implicit3/)
and its [series](https://harry7557558.github.io/spirulae/), the tool that turns [2D images into 3D models 🦀](https://harry7557558.github.io/img23d/),
projects from my [grade 12 🔮](https://harry7557558.github.io/AVI4M-ISP/)
and [grade 11 👀](https://harry7557558.github.io/Graphics/UI/Homework/AVI3M/) art courses in high school,
my [shaders](https://harry7557558.github.io/shadertoy/)
and [Desmos graphs](https://harry7557558.github.io/desmos/) 📈,
and this [volume rendering demo](https://harry7557558.github.io/Graphics/raytracing/webgl_volume/) 🧠.

Stuffs you may find **helpful** 👍 include
[the first one in the cool stuff list 🦑](https://harry7557558.github.io/spirulae/)
and the [3D matrix visualizer 📐](https://harry7557558.github.io/tools/matrixv.html).
Tools that I personally use the most often are
the [MathJax tester](https://harry7557558.github.io/tools/mathjaxt.html),
the [plain text equation typer](https://harry7557558.github.io/miscellaneous/text-tools/plaintext.html),
and this [color picker](https://harry7557558.github.io/tools/colorpicker.html).
Another "worth mention" is this
[chemical equation balancer 🧪](https://harry7557558.github.io/tools/chemequ.html).

Two cool 🤩 repositories of mine are
[Spirulae graphing calculator 🐚](https://github.com/harry7557558/spirulae) and
[SVG to Desmos 🎨](https://github.com/harry7557558/svg-to-desmos).
The [Graphics](https://github.com/harry7557558/Graphics) repository is a collection of
my computer graphics and numerical algorithm experiments done over years 🤯.
The [harry7557558.github.io](https://github.com/harry7557558/harry7557558.github.io) repository
was created to share my stuff that I feel cool and/or useful (listed above) as well as others 👀.
The [miscellaneous](https://github.com/harry7557558/miscellaneous) repository contains mainly
scripts that I write to automate work and satisfy curiosity 🌎.

A list of things I've made and am working on can be found [here](./list-of-projects.md).
Regardless of all the cool stuff listed above,
not well known is the true identity of the entity behind all these 👁️. 
One thing to note is that
[**harry7557558**](https://harry7557558.github.io/) is not a "normal" human being 🤖😈🤒.
