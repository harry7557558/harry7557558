Hello 👋 this is my GitHub profile.
I'm interested in **numerical analysis** and **computer graphics**,
and you can find a lot of code about these topics ~~written from scratch~~ on my GitHub.

My **cool** 😎 stuffs include the
[3D implicit surface grapher](https://harry7557558.github.io/spirula/implicit3/index.html)
and its [series](https://harry7557558.github.io/spirula/),
projects from my [grade 12](https://harry7557558.github.io/AVI4M-ISP/index.html)
and [grade 11](https://harry7557558.github.io/Graphics/UI/Homework/AVI3M/index.html) art courses,
my [Shadertoy](https://harry7557558.github.io/shadertoy/index.html)
and [Desmos graphs](https://harry7557558.github.io/desmos/index.html),
and this [volume rendering demo](https://harry7557558.github.io/Graphics/raytracing/webgl_volume/index.html).

Stuffs you may find **helpful** 👍 include
[the first one in the cool stuff list](https://harry7557558.github.io/spirula/)
and the [3D matrix visualizer](https://harry7557558.github.io/tools/matrixv.html).
My tools that I personally use the most often are
the [MathJax tester](https://harry7557558.github.io/tools/mathjaxt.html)
and this [color picker](https://harry7557558.github.io/tools/colorpicker.html).
Other "worth mentions" include the
[chemical equation balancer](https://harry7557558.github.io/tools/chemequ.html).

The [Graphics](https://github.com/harry7557558/Graphics) repository is a collection of
my computer graphics and numerical analysis experiments done over years 🤓.
The [harry7557558.github.io](https://github.com/harry7557558/harry7557558.github.io) repository
was created to share stuff that I found cool or useful (listed above) as well as others 👀.
The [miscellaneous](https://github.com/harry7557558/miscellaneous) repository contains mainly
scripts that I write to automate work and satisfy curiosity 🌎.
Most of my repositories are collections of code instead of individual projects.

An "about me" can be found in this
[essay from a grade-school English course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kPZR1pcpAQbeRbjvexFIa1hHDHlmzMwx9m2K0_GtyqI/preview),
which initially received a below-average grade.
[This page](https://harry7557558.github.io/dall-e/index.html) may also serve that purpose.
